# Echoes Player Lite - Angular2 Version
This is a project from the book Reactive Programming with Angular and ngrx by Oren Farhi.

It can be regarded as the Media Player experience for youtube listening pleasure.


## Tech Review
it's a sample web app built with Angular JS v2.x, Bootstrap v3.x, Typescript, ES2015 and SystemJs with Loader Spec.


### Quick start
**Make sure you have Node version >= 5.0 and NPM >= 3**
> Clone/Download the repo then edit `app.ts` inside [`/src/app/app.ts`](/src/app/app.ts)

```bash
# install the repo with npm
npm install

# start the server
npm start

# use Hot Module Replacement
npm run server:dev:hmr
```
go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## Running the app
After you have installed all dependencies you can now run the app. Run `npm run server` to start a local server using `webpack-dev-server` which will watch, build (in-memory), and reload for you. The port will be displayed to you as `http://0.0.0.0:3000` (or if you prefer IPv6, if you're using `express` server, then it's `http://[::1]:3000/`).
